\usage{
esWinsorize(es, subtractcovar = FALSE, log = FALSE, covar, base = "",
  intervals = c(0.1, 0.9))
}
\arguments{
\item{es}{expression set %% ~~Describe \code{es} here~~}

\item{subtractcovar}{If the base is specificed and the subtractcovar set to
TRUE, then it will find the base of the selected covariate and it will apply
the normalization of that covariate and then it will take the entire assay
data or expression values and will scale the expression data to the
reference base on a log scale.}

\item{log}{log is set to TRUE, it will take the data and set it equal 2 to
the power of the expression set}

\item{covar}{covar is covariate of interest}

\item{base}{base is used as a reference for scaling}

\item{intervals}{winsorizing process caps the outliers to the intervals
selected. Where .1 is 10th percentile value and .9 is 90th percentile value.
Acts as a ceiling.}
}
\description{
Winsorization creates a upper and lower bounds for reducing the influence of
outliers, such that if the outlier past either bound, it is given a constant
value at the bound, as opposed its real value as an outlier.
